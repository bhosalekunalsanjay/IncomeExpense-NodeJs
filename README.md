# NodeAPIs: Learning Express.js with Node.js

Welcome to the NodeAPIs repository! This collection of code is designed exclusively for learning purposes and is not intended for deployment in live or ongoing web applications. The primary objective of this repository is to provide a hands-on approach to mastering API development using the Express.js framework within Node.js.

## Objectives

The central goals of this repository are:

- **Local API Development:** Build and test APIs locally, ensuring a controlled environment for experimentation and learning.

- **Fundamental Concept Understanding:** Acquire a strong grasp of foundational concepts, enabling you to confidently work with Node.js and Express.js.

- **Robust API Creation:** Strive to create well-structured and robust APIs that showcase industry best practices.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey into API development with Node.js and Express.js, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhosalekunalsanjay/NodeAPIs.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Move into the newly cloned project directory:

   ```bash
   cd NodeAPIs
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Explore the Code:** Dive into the codebase, examining the various API examples and related documentation.

5. **Run the API:** Launch the API server locally by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code as you learn.
